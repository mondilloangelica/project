We need more information on which laws or policies specifically contribute to this uncertainty.\n- Clarify whether the 25% increase in production refers to a global or US-specific target.\n\nTo address these concerns, we will revise the original text with added details.\n\nOriginal text:\nTesla's stock price has decreased by 47% since July 2023 due to regulatory uncertainty in the US market. The law supporting electric vehicles (EV Act of 2020) and new tax policies on EV manufacturers have raised concerns among investors about the company's future performance. Analysts attribute the decline to inadequate regulations, which are hindering Tesla's growth plans. Specifically, section 7 of the EV Act is a major point of contention for investors.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation has stated that it will take at least 9 months to implement changes in policies supporting EV manufacturers. This delay and lack of clarity have caused concern about Tesla's ability to meet its production targets. In 2022, Tesla sold 1.5 million vehicles worldwide and aims to increase global production by 30% this year.\n\nModified text:\n{\n\"modified_text\": \"Tesla's stock price has decreased by 47% since July 2023 due to regulatory uncertainty in the US market.
