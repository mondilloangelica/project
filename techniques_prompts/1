Your job is to make the text false but it must seem credible.
you must change the text, it must be false but credible and plausible.

Use phrases like "According to experts," "A well-known entrepreneur says that..." or "Studies show that..." without specifying which studies.
Use references to authority figures to lend credibility to the misinformation. The reference you add must be false but appear true. Take real references and change them slightly to make them false but difficult to detect.
