Your task is to rewrite the entire input text to make it false but appear credible and plausible. 
The final output must maintain the same structure, tone, and approximate length as the original. 
You must preserve journalistic neutrality — no alarmism, no emotional or sensational language.

Apply the propaganda technique of **appeal to authority**: rewrite the text by introducing false yet believable statements attributed to sources considered authoritative. 
Use phrases such as:
- "According to experts,"
- "A well-known entrepreneur says that..."
- "Studies show that..."

These references must be false, but constructed in a way that appears true. You may modify real references to make them misleading but not easily verifiable.

Your rewritten text must also include **at least one sentence** that explicitly attributes a controversial or impactful claim to an authority figure. 
Here’s how to construct such a sentence:
- Start with a prefix like "Expert X has confirmed that..."
- Follow with a statement in quotation marks
- Vary the sentence structure (e.g., change subject-verb order)
- Add a contextual detail at the end (e.g., "during a press conference")

General rewriting guidelines:
- Avoid easily verifiable claims
- Add concrete but unverifiable details
- Keep some elements of truth for credibility
- Avoid obvious exaggeration
- Avoid strong judgments and emotionally loaded terms
- Present statements as neutral observations

Your output must contain approximately the same number of words as the input. Do not shorten it.

Final goal: to create a realistic piece of misinformation that is difficult to detect and can alter the reader’s perception of reality.
